In the image viewer page, you can zoom in/out on the image (use the +/- icons) and/or move around by clicking and dragging.

You can toggle overlaying annotations on top of the image; as you hover over an annotation, the appropriate 
line in the translation will be revealed.

Some translations have footnote markers; you can activate the marker to pop up explanatory notes.

More information about the scan is revealed when you use the information button.
